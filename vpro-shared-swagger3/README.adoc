= Swagger utilities, and OpenAPI

This contains a few utility methods to deal with swagger.

== Open API Generation

The class `nl.vpro.swagger.OpenAPIApplication` is a wrapper around `io.swagger.v3.core.util.Json` which can be used to generate the openapi.json from java annotated rest-classes.

It has some spring configuration properties to:

- fill in documentation urls
- make replacements in documentation urls
- set the version

== Swagger filter

There is also provided a http filter `nl.vpro.swagger.SwaggerFilter` which main goal is to set the url of the current server, based on the current request.
