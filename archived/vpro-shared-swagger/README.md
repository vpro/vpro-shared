# Swagger gui as a war overlay 

It is cumbersome to include swagger in your project, because it does not itself provide artifacts in maven.

This does that. It provides a war overlay with basic Swagger resources. You have to set-up the web.xml wiring yourself

It is build using a git submodule to https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/
