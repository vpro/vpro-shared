= Set up log4j2

Just arranges dependencies to set up log4j2. Arranges logging from jul and slf4j (1 &amp; 2) to log4j2.

== Usage

Add the dependency to your project:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.vpro.shared</groupId>
    <artifactId>vpro-shared-log4j2</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.1</version>
</dependency>
----

This is possible to:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>nl.vpro.shared</groupId>
    <artifactId>vpro-shared-log4j2</artifactId>
    <version>5.14.1</version>
    <classifier>test</classifier>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
This will accomplish the same things, but this jar also includes a default `log4j2-test.xml` configuration file, which will then be used when running tests. This is useful if you want to use logging in your test with minimal hassle in setting it up.
