We collect some generic Jackson3 utilities. Mainly `tools.jackson.databind.ValueSerializer`s and `tools.jackson.databind.ValueDeserializer`s.

Some of them are bundled in modules. E.g. a `nl.vpro.jackson3.DateModule`, which can will make a `tools.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` recognize `java.time` classes
(but a bit differently then `com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jsr310.JavaTimeModule` does, which it predates).

Also `nl.vpro.jackson2.Views` is provided which defines a few classes which can be used with `@com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonView`.

== JsonArrayIterator

This package also contains `nl.vpro.jackson3.JsonArrayIterator`. A tool to wrap, using jackson, a stream of json object into an iterator of java objects.
